Howdy! It's me, Justine. Go get your vaccine! Today is my brother's birthday. I did math, science, and english. I ate oreo ice cream cake for breakfast, duck and dumplings for lunch, and Phil's Barbecue for dinner. Now I am learning to use Github. For my brother's birthday I made a cute brown bunny soft toy. It is so cute.
