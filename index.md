## Howdy! 
I like to draw! I am NOT an animator, but occasionally I make animatics. (Animatics are not the same as animations.)
## Hobbies
I draw, animate, and write stories.
## Favourites
I like to draw, read fictitious stories, and play with my cats. My favourite colour is pink.
## Personal Info
I was born on May 29, 2008. I am a Rat according to the Chinese Zodiac, and a Gemini in the constellation zodiac.
## Youtube
I have a channel on Youtube called . . .

Justine Yong.

Wow, so creative, right? I have a mere 15 subscribers. Half of them are from Dumbledore's Army(more on that later), and the other half is just from my brothers and other friends. I have another channel called Moony and Sirius(M&S) for my cats, it has 9 subscribers.

I plan on creating a third channel. I haven't decided on the name yet, but I'm considering the options 'Justine's Rants' and 'Squaggles'. Justine's Rants because (hopefully) the first video I'll be making will be about a rant on how ANNOYING Jar Jar Binks is. (He's that anthropomorphic half-squid half-snail half-alien hybrid.) And Squaggles because that is one of my cat's (Moony) nickname.
## Personality
I do not know how other people will describe me, partly based on who I interview. I think in general I'm not *very* social. Yes, online I talk *a lot* with my friends in Dumbledore's Army(more on that later, I promise) but in person and with other . . .I'm not sure how to put it but with other REAL people I tend to be rather shy. Actually shy's not really the word. More like reclusive. I'm quite the loner when it comes to socialising. Group projects I do alone. Games I play against myself when possible. And drawing's just a solitary activity, unless you count Drawasaurus which isn't really that fun.
## Dumbledore's Army
Finally! Dumbledore's Army is a group of kids who were stuck at home and couldn't go to school. Through the floof moths, spammakins and rising tempers, let me explain the role of each of the members. (That was the intro to a cringey rap I once wrote. If I hear it one more time I'm literally going to die.) 

So like in the first sentence, Dumbledore's Army just a group of regular kids(except for Dakota, she's special ðŸ˜†). We formed it in . . . somewhere in  2020? I can't recall when, only it was somewhere in 2020 near the end of sixth grade.
### Rant #1
Oh my god I just realised that when we left school, we were in 6th grade and *we're coming back as 8th graders*. WOW time flies!
P.S. Oh, and by the way, my rants are nowhere as long as Dakota's. Mine are nothing compared to hers (I mean, look at it! Mine's literally 2 lines/sentences long and hers takes up at least half a page. They might get longer over time though.)

This is all I have so far. I will (hopefully) be updating this every day, week, month, or even year. Or decade. But I'm barely past my first decade.
